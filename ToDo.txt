Notes by Michael Tautschnig <tautschnig@forsyte.de> taken while doing the
CPA->CPA+ transition (2008-12-12):

* a cleanup and prioritization will follow *

- Remove getAbstractDomain in those cases where it is now not needed anymore

- We have multiple implementations of a class Path

- SymbPredAbstTransfer has its own Top/Bottom element !?

- Whitespace at the end of a line is undesirable for merging tools, do a cleanup

- Instead of the String parameters to set sep or join for merge and stop just
  create multiple CPA classes that fix the operator

- Review itpexplicit logs, they contain unexpected warnings since r170 already

- Use iterators instead of get(i), this is CLEANER, SAFER, and FASTER in general
  (unless impossible, of course)

- Cleanup cpa.common and move the composite stuff to compositecpa

- null precision after refinement
- in createReachedSet use a safe cast instead of reflection+cruel cast
- compositestop is borked (does not care about precision)

- add basic implementations of stop, mergesep/join, precision stuff
- review mergeJoin for the use of joinOperator

- cleanup stop operator, rename compositestopsep, compositemergesep

- move getInitialElement to its own class
  * method makeInitialElement (AE, AEwLoc, must be static)

- cleanup CPAMain
  * make separate function "preprocess"
  * is there any non-interprocedural analysis
