# "Predicate Abstraction with Adjustable-Block Encoding" (Beyer et al.).
# It is configured for abstractions at loop heads, similar to LBE but

# Abstractions are stored as formulas (not as BDDs) and the refinement
# process is the one from the tool Impact from McMillan,
# which was presented in the paper "Lazy Abstraction with Interpolants"
# THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL
