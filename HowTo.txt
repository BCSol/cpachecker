CPAchecker Installation Requirements

Requirements for executing CPAchecker:
0. Sources have to be preprocessed by CIL (http://hal.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/).
   Necessary flags: 
   --dosimplify --printCilAsIs --save-temps --domakeCFG
   Possibly necessary flags:
   --dosimpleMem

Building CPAchecker:
--------------------
1. Install Java 1.6 SDK or higher.
   http://java.sun.com/
   Or contact Michael Tautschnig <tautschnig@forsyte.de> to
   obtain patches to make it work and compile with 1.5
   (may show degraded performance, though).
2. Install Eclipse 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5
   http://www.eclipse.org/
3. You need the JDT and the "Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment" package (PDE).
4. Install the C/C++ Development Kit for your Eclipse version
   (tested with CDT 4.0 and CDT 6.0).   
   Or contact Michael Tautschnig <tautschnig@forsyte.de> to
   obtain patches to make it work with CDT 5
   You need to install only the "Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools SDK" package.

For building in Eclipse:
5. You need an SVN plugin for Eclipse, e.g. SubClipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org/).
   Create new project from SVN repository
   URL: http://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk
6. If you need the parser and scanner classes or you want to remove the compiler
   errors shown by Eclipse, run "ant build-subprojects" in the project directory.

For building with Ant:
5. Install ant (anything since version 1.6 should be ok).
6. Set the environment variable ECLIPSE_HOME to the directory where
   your eclipse is installed (the one that contains the plugins directory)
   and run ant from the project root directory.

Running CPAchecker:
-------------------
7. Choose a configuration file and a source code file
   Example: test/config/explicitAnalysisInf.properties
            test/programs/simple/loop1.c
   Check that the configuration file does not contain any non-existent paths 

Running it from Eclipse:
8. Create a run configuration with main class "cmdline.CPAMain", 
   program arguments "-config <CONFIG_FILE> <SOURCE_FILE>", and
   VM arguments "-Djava.library.path=lib/native/<ENVIRONMENT>" 
   specifying your environment for the library path. 
   Settings for <ENVIRONMENT>: 
   		ppc-macosx, x86_64-linux, x86-linux, x86-macosx,  x86-win32

Running it from command line:
8. Execute "scripts/cpa.sh -config <CONFIG_FILE> <SOURCE_FILE>"
   If your Eclipse is not installed to ~/eclipse, /opt/eclipse or ~/Desktop/eclipse,
   you need to set the environment variable ECLIPSE_HOME to the directory where
   your eclipse is installed (the one that contains the plugins directory).

Running test cases:
-------------------
9.  Install ant and ant-junit.jar (ob Debian/Ubuntu you need the package ant-optional).
10. Set the environment variable ECLIPSE_HOME as described unter "building with Ant"
11. Run "ant tests" from the project root directory. The output (including the test
    results) will be in test/output/.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- Imports starting with org.eclipse are not recognized.
  Errors "Project 'CPAChecker (svn trunk)' is missing required library: 'bin/'" and
  		 "The Project cannot be built until build path errors are resolved" occur.
  Solution: Double-check PDE is installed (see step 2).
  			This renders manually inserting the respective .jar files unnecessary.
- Libraries are missing.
  Error (example): "libgmpxx.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
  Solution: Install the missing library ('libgmpxx4ldbl' in this case on debian/ubuntu systems)
