Style Guide

Spelling:
- Names are spelled camel-like, whereEachNewWordStartsWithCapital.
- Type names start with a capital,
  and each sub-type name starts with an abbreviation of the type
  (allows for look-up of type hierarchy via auto completion/listing). 
- Method names start lower case.
- Variable names start lower case,
  where an attribute starts with 'm' and a local variable starts with 'l'.

Formatting:
- A block is surrounded by parentheses, e.g., if (...) { ...blah-block... }.

Compilation:
- Warnings are taken serious, and problems should be fixed if possible.
  (When it becomes to many, we can't see the important ones anymore.)
- Errors are to be eliminated as soon as possible.
  (Annoying.)
