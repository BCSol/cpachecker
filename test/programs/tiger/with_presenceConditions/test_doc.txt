Test with this CPAchecker call:

time ./scripts/cpa.sh -preprocess -config test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/configuration_with_pc.properties test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/FASE2015_draft_example.c

17.12.2014 Runs in 5 seconds.
	real	0m4.930s
	user	0m11.306s
	sys	0m0.581s
	Saved the testsuite to ./output/testsuite.txt
	Produced testsuite looks ok, however tiger finds 19 testgoals instead of 12 in expected-result.png
	I would rather believe tiger as the expected-result.png is probably simplified for a paper.
Comment: in the output CPAchecker complains about "The following configuration options were specified but are not used:"
	Probably the config has not been updated.
	
	
19.12.2014 Reusing ARG for testgoals, resetting it when starting on next testgoal. (tiger.reuseARG = true)
time ./scripts/cpa.sh -preprocess -config test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/configuration_with_pc_withARGreuse.properties test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/FASE2015_draft_example.c
	Test result: So far, this does not work. tiger finds one testcase, then reuses the ARG and finds the same testcase (same pc) again, and again, and again ...
		The first pc should be excluded from future searches but that does not seem to happen?
