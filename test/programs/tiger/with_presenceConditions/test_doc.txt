Test with this CPAchecker call:

time ./scripts/cpa.sh -preprocess -config test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/configuration_with_pc.properties test/programs/tiger/with_presenceConditions/FASE2015_draft_example.c

17.12.2014 Runs in 5 seconds.
	real	0m4.930s
	user	0m11.306s
	sys	0m0.581s
	Saved the testsuite to ./output/testsuite.txt
	Produced testsuite looks ok, however tiger finds 19 testgoals instead of 12 in expected-result.png
	I would rather believe tiger as the expected-result.png is probably simplified for a paper.
Comment: in the output CPAchecker complains about "The following configuration options were specified but are not used:"
	Probably the config has not been updated.
