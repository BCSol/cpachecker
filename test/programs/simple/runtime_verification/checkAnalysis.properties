# This configuration file uses the Adjustable-Block Encoding CPA

# "Predicate Abstraction with Adjustable-Block Encoding" (Beyer et al.).
# It is configured for abstractions at loop heads, similar to LBE but
# with function inlining.
# This configuration works best on most examples,
# but may have memory problems on really big programs.
