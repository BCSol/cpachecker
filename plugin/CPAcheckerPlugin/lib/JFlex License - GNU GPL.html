                  <P>JFlex is free software, published under the terms of the GNU <A HREF="#GPL">General
Public License</A>.

<P>There is absolutely <A HREF="#no warranty">NO WARRANTY</A> for JFlex,
its code and its documentation.

<P>The code generated by JFlex inherits the copyright of the specification it
was produced from. If it was your specification, you may use the generated 
code without restriction.

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="GPL">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></H2>
<B>0.</B> This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,
a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee
is addressed as "you".

<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
on what the Program does.

<P><B>1.</B> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<P><B>2.</B> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>a)</B> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</LI>

<LI>
<B>b)</B> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License.</LI>

<LI>
<B>c)</B> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including
an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
Program is not required to print an announcement.)</LI>
</UL>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of
a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it.

<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Program.

<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.

<P><B>3.</B> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&nbsp;<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --><!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>
<LI>
<B>a)</B> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</LI>

<LI>
<B>b)</B> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</LI>

<LI>
<B>c)</B> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
b above.)</LI>
</UL>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.

<P><B>4.</B> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<P><B>5.</B> You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

<P><B>6.</B> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

<P><B>7.</B> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<P><B>8.</B> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.

<P><B>9.</B> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

<P><B>10.</B> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

<P><B><A NAME="no warranty">NO WARRANTY</a></b>

<P><B>11.</B> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<P><B>12.</B> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
